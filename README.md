# Linear-and-Binary-Searching-Algorithms
Computer uses binary search and linear search to find values inputted by user.
User is prompted 3 times by the computer give a value based on 3 different situations.
Computer then uses both a linear and binary search through list to find inputted user value.
If computer finds value, it additionally outputs how many iterations through the list it completes to find value through both searching algorithms.
If computer cannot find value, it will output that it cannot find value.
User input is case sensitive.
